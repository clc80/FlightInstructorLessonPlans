# FlightInstructorLessonPlans

## User Story to TDD
As a flight instructor I want to be able to customize a lesson plan for any student. 

### Scenario
From a list of flight maneuvers I can select different ones to add to today's lesson plan. When finished with the selection I can press the done button and be taken to a different page I can share with my student. 

### Steps
* Get all flight maneuvers and display them on screen
* User selects specific maneuvers
* User hits done button
* Selected flight maneuvers are saved 
* Selected flight maneuvers are displayed on new screen with any additional information
* User can go back and make changes as needed
